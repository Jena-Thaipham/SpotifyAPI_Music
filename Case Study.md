## Key Insights

1. **Emerging vs. Famous Artist Profiles:**  
   While Famous artists have higher follower counts and larger catalogs, Emerging artists can achieve comparable popularity, indicating rising influence despite lower audience reach.

2. **Playlist Exposure Challenges:**  
   The follower gap metric shows that playlist owners typically have fewer followers than the Emerging artists featured. This indicates that the current playlists may provide limited exposure benefits to the artists, suggesting a need to target playlists managed by users with larger audiences to boost artist visibility effectively.

3. **Productivity & Trend Dynamics:**  
   Yearly trends show Emerging artists steadily increasing album and track releases, with rapid growth in followers and popularity over time.

## Business Recommendations

- **Leverage Playlist Placements:**  
  Prioritize featuring Emerging artists on high-follower playlists to boost exposure and follower growth.

- **Early Identification of Rising Talent:**  
  Monitor popularity and productivity metrics to invest in artists with high growth potential.

Facilitate direct interaction between artists and fans through social media, live events, and fan-driven playlists to deepen loyalty and increase organic growth.

## Action Plan

   Integrate additional engagement metrics like monthly listeners from paid APIs.

2. **Segment Audience:**  
   Develop user profiles by geography and listening behavior to customize marketing efforts.

3. **Cross-Platform Analysis:**  
   Incorporate data from YouTube, Apple Music, and other platforms for holistic artist performance insights.
