Overview
This document provides guidance on how to interact with the two dashboards created to analyze and compare music artists based on Spotify data.

ðŸ”¹ Dashboard 1: Emerging vs. Famous Artists Overview
This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview comparing Emerging and Famous artists based on their popularity, follower count, and key performance metrics. The charts are color-coded consistently across the dashboard to distinguish between the two groups:
Emerging Artists: High popularity but low follower count


Famous Artists: High popularity and high follower count


Thresholds are calculated based on statistical analysis of the full dataset:
Follower thresholds are based on log-scale mean and standard deviation:
 low_log = round(mean_log - std_log, 2)
 high_log = round(mean_log + std_log, 2)


Popularity thresholds are based on:
 low_threshold = round(mean_pop - std_pop, 2)
 high_threshold = round(mean_pop + std_pop, 2)
