This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview comparing Emerging and Famous artists based on their popularity, follower count, and key performance metrics. The charts are color-coded consistently across the dashboard to distinguish between the two groups:

- **Emerging Artists:** High popularity but low follower count  
- **Famous Artists:** High popularity and high follower count

### Thresholds are calculated based on statistical analysis of the full dataset:

- **Follower thresholds** are based on log-scale mean and standard deviation:  
low_threshold = round(mean_log - std_log, 2)
high_threshold = round(mean_log + std_log, 2)
- **Popularity thresholds** are based on:  
low_threshold = round(mean_pop - std_pop, 2)
high_threshold = round(mean_pop + std_pop, 2)

**Definition â€“ Follower Gap:**  
Follower Gap = Playlist Ownerâ€™s Follower Count - Average Follower Count of the Artist Group in a specific playlist.

**Insights Provided:**  
This metric illustrates the potential opportunity for an artist to gain visibility by being featured in a playlist. It calculates the gap as the playlist owner's follower count minus the artist's followers.
